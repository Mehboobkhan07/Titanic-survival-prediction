# Titanic-survival-prediction
This project is a data analysis and machine learning endeavor that aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. Using Python and various data science libraries, that I  explore on the Titanic dataset, perform data preprocessing, create visualizations, and build a machine learning model to predict passenger survival.
